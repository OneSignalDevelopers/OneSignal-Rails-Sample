# onesignal-rails-sample

This example project demonstrates how to get started sending email notifications using the [OneSignal Rails Plugin](https://rubygems.org/gems/onesignal-rails). You can use this project as a boilerplate or reference to start your project.

## Running this sample

This project assumes that you already have a OneSignal app created with email setup. If you don't have one made already, you'll need to [create one](https://app.onesignal.com/apps/new) and follow the steps to [add email to OneSignal](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/email-quickstart).

1. Update config/environments/{test,development,production}.rb to set the hostname and OneSignal App ID for the given environments.
2. Set the ONESIGNAL_APP_KEY environment variable in the test and production environments.  For development, you can run with `ONESIGNAL_APP_KEY=XXX bin/rails server`.
